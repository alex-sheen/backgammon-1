# Backgammon (CMSC 15100 Final Project)
Typed/Racket multiplayer backgammon program with support for undoing moves and storing/loading games through serializationâ€”converts structured data into linear string representations and back. Makes ample use of recursion and linked lists. Developed in two styles, **Original** and **Classic**, as pictured below.
